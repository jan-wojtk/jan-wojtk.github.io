Todos:
  - X enforce reasonable maximums on rows & columns (prevent page freeze)
  - X consider moving rows and columns inputs adjacent to each other, for space
  - X mobile tap-and-drag to color rings
  - / improve mobile form UX (set default zoom to 100 when on vertical mobile?)
  - sortable layers
  - stats: total ring count of sheet
  - stats: total wire length of sheet
  - stats: height and width of sheet
  - save-to-session behavior
  - add recent color history to color pickers
  - dry up the color options
  - fix overflow clipping
  
Also, btw:
  - desktop allows right-click to remove the on-click color, but there isn't an analogous action on mobile. This difference in functionality could be effectively lessened by implementing color history, so removes can be done via repaint
